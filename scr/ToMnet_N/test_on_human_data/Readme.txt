Folder description:
(1) This folder contains analysis on human data.
(2) All python scripts are located in sandbox/temporary_testing_version or working_model.
(3) This folder only contains training results as well as a Rscript to convert the
format of human data.
Data source:
(1) Sign in to server: ssh gibmsadmin@140.112.122.160 (pw: See https://gitlab.com/brain-and-mind-lab/notes-for-bml/bmlab-wiki-home/wikis/server#gibms_server%E6%95%99%E5%AD%B8%E6%96%87%E4%BB%B6)
(2) Data path: '/var/www/html/bmlab/ai-robo/game/data'
(3) Note that the txt file is very similar to the simulated txt, except for
	- This is handled by '/scripts/convert_human_data_format/convert_human_data_format.R' to ensure the format of human data to be the same as the simulated data. See README there for details.
(4) Use FileZilla SFTP to log in and download files

Note:
To derive the scores that participants see:
(1) http://gibms.mc.ntu.edu.tw/phpmyadmin
(2) See this for account name and password: https://gitlab.com/brain-and-mind-lab/notes-for-bml/bmlab-wiki-home/wikis/server#gibms_server%E6%95%99%E5%AD%B8%E6%96%87%E4%BB%B6
(3) bmlab/ai_social_game
(4) Note that the scores that participants see = round(averaged score * (23/9)). The column 'agent1_value' shown is rounded, but the original value to derive the score is not rounded. Rounding occurs after *(23/9).

Finished training session (v12, commit d77824) 
Time: 2020/03/03
Author: Chuang, Yun-Shiuan
Output file name: 
/v12

(1) Same as human/v11 except that 
	(1) run on the most updated human data (more files and more subjects)
    (2) include all subjects that have at least 500 augmented data
    (original files >= 500/8 = 62.5)
        - list "24","26","30","33","35","40","43","50","51","52","53","55","58","59",\

Author: Chuang, Yun-Shiuan
Output file name: 
/v11

(1) Same as human/v10 except that 
	(1)the 'augmented data' were used for training and testing.
	(2) Batch size changes back to 16 from 10 because all subjects now have enough data.
	(3) S030 is also included.

Note
(1) All models have higher accuracy with the augmented data.

Finished training session (v10, commit 35e29c) 
Time: 2020/02/11
Author: Chuang, Yun-Shiuan
Output file name: 
/v10

(1) Same as human/v9 except that the following subjects are used for training as well, ['S024', 'S033', 'S035', 'S050', 'S051', 'S052'].
(2) Batch size changes to 10 from 16 because some subject only has about 100 files. Batch size = 16 only works for number of files greater than 160 since the validation and the test set only have 1/10 of the total files. Having 160 files ensures there is at least one batch for dev/test set.

Note
(1) All models trained by each set of the new human data is overfitting.
(2)  The only model with above-random accuracy: S024 (920 trajs). Other subjects have too few trajectories (just above 100).

Output file name: /cache_S002a_v7_commit_0050d9_epoch78600_tuning_batch16_train_step_0.5M_INIT_LR_10-4

(1) Remove the scripts in this folder.
(2) Use the scripts in 'sandbox/temporary' and set the output to here. 
This is because the human data format is identical to 
the simulated data (thanks to the R script), 
so there is no need to separate two set of scripts.

(1) Fix LSTM layer.
(2) Use the same set up as v3 with 2M steps and epoch = 78600.

Note:
(1) Is is still NOT learning! It should not only because of the LSTM issue.
There should be something else.

Author: Chuang, Yun-Shiuan
Output file name: /cache_S030_v3_commit_dd21c9_epoch78600_tuning_batch96_train_step_2M_INIT_LR_10-5

(1) Copy codes again directly from sandbox/temporary (v7, commit c8e358).
(2) Preprocess the txt files by R and convert them to the format of simulated data,
 so no need to adjust the codes at all for human data.

Note:
(1) The validation error by batch is not going down but final validation performace is
not bad though.
(2) Performace:

Accuracy: 40.46%
vali: proportion_accuracy()
Accuracy: 40.46%
test: match_estimation()
Accuracy: 38.01%

Note:
(1) Not learning at all. Terminated manully.

Finished training session (v1, commit 95ab2d) [At working_model/human_data]
Time: 2019/05/21
Author: Chuang, Yun-Shiuan
Output file name: /cache_S030_v1_commit_95ab2d_epoch8000_tuning_batch96_train_step_40M_INIT_LR_10-5

Description:
(1) Use the model architecture (v7, commit c8e358) [At sandbox/temporary]
(2) Use the commented_data_handler.py (v10, commit 5951c9) [At working_model]. I modify the function parse_trajectory() to handle human data, which slightly differs from the simulated data in term of format (see above at 'Folder description').

Note:
(1) Not learning at all. Terminated manully.
(2) Mistakenly set epoch size = 8000.
